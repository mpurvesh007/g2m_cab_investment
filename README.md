# XYZ Cab Industry Analysis

## Project Overview

XYZ is a private firm planning to invest in the cab industry in the US. To support their decision-making, an in-depth analysis was conducted on four datasets representing different aspects of customer profiles, transactions, and city information. The goal is to provide valuable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Data Overview

- Explored four datasets: Cab_Data, Customer_ID, Transaction_ID, and City.
- Checked for missing values and data types.
- Converted date formats, corrected data types, and created new features.

## Data Preprocessing

- Corrected date formats and created a 'Profit' feature based on 'Cost of Trip' and 'Price Charged.'
- Cleaned 'Users' and 'Population' columns in the City dataset.
- Merged datasets to create a Masterdata file.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Explored city-wise cab users, customer demographics, profit trends, and seasonal demand.
- Visualized customer and ride distribution, profit per kilometer, and market reach.
- Analyzed the correlation between profit and city population.

## Hypothesis Testing

- Conducted six hypotheses tests on gender distribution, profit margins, customer age, weekend demand, customer income, and profit correlation with city population.

## Conclusion

- Yellow Cab has a significantly higher demand, customer base and customer retention
- Yellow Cab has a higher profit margin per kilometer.
- Both companies have similar customer demographics.
- Market reach varies across cities.
- Higher demand during weekends for both companies.

## Recommendations

- Consider market reach and demand patterns in specific cities.
- Focus on cities where Yellow Cab has a stronger presence.
- Optimize marketing strategies based on customer preferences.
- Analyze seasonal trends for resource allocation and marketing efforts.

## Future Work

- Explore customer satisfaction and feedback data.
- Consider external factors impacting demand.
- Implement predictive modeling for future demand and profitability.
